I had the idea to make a choose your own adventure story game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

I am thinking of having the following attributes:

- Brains
- Brawn
- Instincts (Chat GPT helped a lot with this one, as I couldn't settle on the right word.)

We are also going to have d6 rolls

- 1-2 → a good outcome
- 3-4 → a neutral outcome
- 5-6 → a good outcome
- +Modifiers → Based on the player's chosen strengths
These rolls will be affected by the your strenghts.
